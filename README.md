# GPA/Grade Calculator


The three function GPA and grade calculator is a desktop Java application that allows P.I.S.D. students to easily determine their class averages, overall and per-class GPAs, and the minimum score they'd have to earn on their next assignment to pass their class with a 70%.

Currently, I'm drafting new features that aim to make the calculator usable by college students, and planning to expand upon existing features.

A reorganization of the code is also underway. I wrote the majority of this program many years ago when I was first learning, and though it's not, er, terrible, it could definitely use some work.
