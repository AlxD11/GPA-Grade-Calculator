# GPA and Grade Calculator (Archive)

This three-function GPA and grade calculator allows P.I.S.D. students to easily determine their class averages, overall and per-class GPAs, and the minimum score to earn on their next assignment to pass their class with a 70%. It's built as a Java desktop application with a GUI based on the Swing library.

## History

This was my first serious program. I wrote it in senior high when I, somewhat ironically, was screwing around during compsci class. (Basic data structures and algorithms were hard; picking apart examples in the Swing textbook I wasn't supposed to be reading was _fun_.) It was for-fun practice with the Java Swing library, but it evolved into a serious project that, miraculously, wound up earning me an A in not just the compsci class I'd been doing nothing in, but somehow also my English class.

Good times.

## Reflections

I wrote the majority of this program many years ago when I was first learning, and though it isn't... terrible... it could definitely use some work.

The practice from this calculator - and the textbook examples that lead to it - serves as the foundation of any UI-driven Java desktop application I have written so far (and will write in the future).
